  Potato:
    description: 'The potato first appeared in Peru about ten thousand years ago. The potato was an early food source, and likely a highly traded good in early South America. Having been traded for several thousand years, and enduring much artifical selection, the explorers of the sixteenth and seventeenth century brought the potato back to Europe, where the crop grew. Originally thought to be poisonous and evil, the crop didnt become a major food for another hundred years.Following its introduction into China toward the end of the Ming dynasty in the seventeenth century, the potato immediately became a delicacy of the imperial family.By the time potatoes were introduced into Europe, the fork was already prevalent. Hence, started the tradition of forking the potato.A lack of equal rights for potatoes led to a disease spreading between them and endangered the tradition of forking the potato in Ireland. Fortunately, other areas of the world maintained their healthy, diverse potatoes, and so the tradition lives on.' #Fork a potato https://github.com/drtshock/Potato
  Attack_Helicopter:
    description: 'I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Apache" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.'
